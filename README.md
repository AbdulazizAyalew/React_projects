# React Practice Projects

This repository contains my hands-on practice projects while learning **React**.  
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of core React concepts by building small, focused examples and components.

## 🚀 What I’m Practicing
- React functional components and JSX
- Props and component reusability
- State management with `useState`
- Conditional rendering
- Rendering lists with `map()`
- Data manipulation using `filter()` and `reduce()`
- Organizing project structure with multiple components

## 📂 Project Structure
Each folder or file focuses on a specific concept, making it easy to understand and revise React fundamentals.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository is intended for:
- Daily React practice
- Reinforcing JavaScript concepts used in React
- Building a solid foundation before moving to larger projects

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (basic styling)
- Vite (or Create React App)

## 📌 Status
This is an **ongoing learning repository**. More examples and improvements will be added regularly.
